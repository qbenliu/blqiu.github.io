Multi-modal tasks usually involve more than one different modalities, and a modality represents a type of behavior or state. Common multi-modal information includes vision, hearing, language, touch, and smell. Vision and language are two of the most common modalities in human daily life, and many typical multi-modal tasks focus on these two modalities, such as visual captioning and visual grounding. In this paper, we conduct in-depth research on typical tasks of vision and language from the perspectives of generation, analysis, and reasoning. First, the analysis and summary with the typical tasks and some pretty classical methods are introduced, which will be generalized from the aspects of different algorithmic concerns, and be further discussed frequently used datasets and metrics. Then, some other variant tasks and cutting-edge tasks are briefly summarized to build a more comprehensive vision and language related multi-modal tasks framework. Finally, we further discuss the development of pre-training related research and make an outlook for future research. We hope this survey can help relevant researchers to understand the latest progress, existing problems, and exploration directions of vision and language multi-modal related tasks, and provide guidance for future research.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"A Survey of Vision and Language Related Multi-Modal Task","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benliu Qiu","Heqian Qiu","Haitao Wen","Zichen Song","Linfeng Xu"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1667088e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1667088e3,"objectID":"2b0a2fcfa5867fd981939030d9198de2","permalink":"https://qbenliu.github.io/publication/qiu2022cross/","publishdate":"2022-10-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/qiu2022cross/","section":"publication","summary":"In this work, we research a new task: cross-domain object detection with missing classes in target domain, where there are only partial classes have images and annotations in the target domain.","tags":[],"title":"Cross-Domain Object Detection with Missing Classes in Target Domain","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lanxiao Wang","Chao Shang","Heqian Qiu","Taijin Zhao","Benliu Qiu","Hongliang Li"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1601424e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601424e3,"objectID":"bbb937aaaa70abc2618502d3ffc939f0","permalink":"https://qbenliu.github.io/publication/wang2020multi/","publishdate":"2020-09-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wang2020multi/","section":"publication","summary":"\r","tags":[],"title":"Multi-stage tag guidance network in video caption","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benliu Qiu","Yuejiang Li","Yan Chen","H Vicky Zhao"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1572393600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572393600,"objectID":"820eb2aa725e0ee06885689378fd57ca","permalink":"https://qbenliu.github.io/publication/qiu2019controlling/","publishdate":"2019-10-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/qiu2019controlling/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we investigated how to control the information diffusion over networks through the use of the irrational users.","tags":[],"title":"Controlling Information Diffusion with Irrational Users","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuejiang Li","Benliu Qiu","Yan Chen","H Vicky Zhao"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1553904e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553904e3,"objectID":"68723496d76209dd130f1c57d7cbe06b","permalink":"https://qbenliu.github.io/publication/li2019analysis/","publishdate":"2019-03-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/li2019analysis/","section":"publication","summary":"Modeling and analysis of information diffusion over networks is of crucial importance to better understand the avalanche of information flow over social networks and to investigate its impact on economy and our social life. Different from prior works that study rational behavior in information diffusion, we focus on “irrational users”, e.g., those who always inten-tionally forward fake news even when they know it contains false information. We extend the graphical evolutionary game model for information diffusion, and analyze the impact of such irrational behavior on information propagation. Our simulation results on synthetic networks are consistent with our analytical results, and they show that even a few irrational users can significantly increase the number of users who adopt the forwarding strategy.","tags":[],"title":"Analysis of information diffusion with irrational users: A graphical evolutionary game approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benliu Qiu","Ningxuan Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1543536e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543536e3,"objectID":"3cc71f1f3b089767e69e212f10585a1e","permalink":"https://qbenliu.github.io/publication/qiu2018review/","publishdate":"2018-11-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/qiu2018review/","section":"publication","summary":"Purpose – With the recent development of science and technology, research on information diffusion has become increasingly important.
