In this paper, we find a new type of bias appearing in continual learning, coined as taskinduced bias. We place continual learning into a causal framework, based on which we find the task-induced bias is reduced naturally by two underlying mechanisms in task and domain incremental learning. However, these mechanisms do not exist in class incremental learning (CIL), in which each task contains a unique subset of classes. To eliminate the task-induced bias in CIL, we devise a causal intervention operation so as to cut off the causal path that causes the task-induced bias, and then implement it as a causal debias module that transforms biased features into unbiased ones. In addition, we propose a training pipeline to incorporate the novel module into existing methods and jointly optimize the entire architecture. Our overall approach does not rely on data replay, and is simple and convenient to plug into existing methods. Extensive empirical study on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet shows that our approach can improve accuracy and reduce forgetting of well-established methods by a large margin.","tags":[],"title":"CafeBoost: Causal Feature Boost To Eliminate Task-Induced Bias for Class Incremental Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lanxiao Wang","Wenzhe Hu","Heqian Qiu","Chao Shang","Taijin Zhao","Benliu Qiu","King Ngi Ngan","Hongliang Li"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1672358400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672358400,"objectID":"f3713769f75f5d7e0dc4e1a7549827ce","permalink":"https://qbenliu.github.io/publication/wang2022survey/","publishdate":"2022-12-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wang2022survey/","section":"publication","summary":"\r","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"A Survey of Vision and Language Related Multi-Modal Task","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benliu Qiu","Heqian Qiu","Haitao Wen","Zichen Song","Linfeng Xu"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1667088e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1667088e3,"objectID":"2b0a2fcfa5867fd981939030d9198de2","permalink":"https://qbenliu.github.io/publication/qiu2022cross/","publishdate":"2022-10-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/qiu2022cross/","section":"publication","summary":"\r","tags":[],"title":"Cross-Domain Object Detection with Missing Classes in Target Domain","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lanxiao Wang","Chao Shang","Heqian Qiu","Taijin Zhao","Benliu Qiu","Hongliang Li"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1601424e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601424e3,"objectID":"bbb937aaaa70abc2618502d3ffc939f0","permalink":"https://qbenliu.github.io/publication/wang2020multi/","publishdate":"2020-09-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wang2020multi/","section":"publication","summary":"\r","tags":[],"title":"Multi-stage tag guidance network in video caption","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benliu Qiu","Yuejiang Li","Yan Chen","H Vicky Zhao"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1572393600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572393600,"objectID":"820eb2aa725e0ee06885689378fd57ca","permalink":"https://qbenliu.github.io/publication/qiu2019controlling/","publishdate":"2019-10-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/qiu2019controlling/","section":"publication","summary":"\r","tags":[],"title":"Controlling Information Diffusion with Irrational Users","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuejiang Li","Benliu Qiu","Yan Chen","H Vicky Zhao"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1553904e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553904e3,"objectID":"68723496d76209dd130f1c57d7cbe06b","permalink":"https://qbenliu.github.io/publication/li2019analysis/","publishdate":"2019-03-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/li2019analysis/","section":"publication","summary":"\r","tags":[],"title":"Analysis of information diffusion with irrational users: A graphical evolutionary game approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benliu Qiu","Ningxuan Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1543536e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543536e3,"objectID":"3cc71f1f3b089767e69e212f10585a1e","permalink":"https://qbenliu.github.io/publication/qiu2018review/","publishdate":"2018-11-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/qiu2018review/","section":"publication","summary":"\r","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"A Review on Graphical Evolutionary Game for Information Diffusion on Social Networks","type":"publication"}]
